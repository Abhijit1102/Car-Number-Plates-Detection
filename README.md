# Car Number Plate Detection Project

## Overview

The Car Number Plate Detection project is designed to detect and recognize car number plates using computer vision techniques. This project leverages [mention the technology or library you used, such as OpenCV or TensorFlow] to achieve accurate and efficient number plate detection.

## Features

- **Number Plate Detection:** Identify and locate car number plates in images.
- **Character Recognition:** Extract and recognize characters from the detected number plates.
- **Accuracy:** Achieve high accuracy in number plate detection and character recognition.
